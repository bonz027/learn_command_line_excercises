#Can you make a directory?#

Yes! By typing in *mkdir* in the terminal I can then make any directory I want. For example *mkdir davinci* would be a 
directory I can use. 

#Can you make a log directory in your class directory?#

Sure I can. If I am already in my class directory, I can type in *mkdir log* and that will create a *log* directory.
