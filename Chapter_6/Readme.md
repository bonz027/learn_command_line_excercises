#What's in the tmp directory?
The tmp directory contains mostly files that are required temporarily. 

#Can you show me what files are in that directory?
Yes! By typing in cd /tmp in the terminal, then once in the tmp directory I can type 
ls to view it's contents and I get the following:

#What files are in your home directory?
By typing cd ~ in the terminal, this will take me to my home directory, where I can then type ls and see
what files are in my home directory. Here is what I get:
