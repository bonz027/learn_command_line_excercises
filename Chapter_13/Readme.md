##Can you remove **blah.txt**?##

I entered **cd ../../** to move up to the **learn_command_line_exercises** then cd to Chapter_11/temp (where the blah.txt
exist) here i enter **rm blah.txt** to remove it form the directory.

##Let's get rid of our development log file.##

**cd ..**, to move up a directory, then **cd log** then enter **rm development.log**

##Can you remove everything in the slash temp slash foo directory?##

yes. by entering **rm -rf */temp /foo** i can delete everything in both directories. 

## Running the **rm -rf/** command deletes everything!!!
