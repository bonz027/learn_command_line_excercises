##How big is foo.txt?##

Not sure the answer to this one. It looks like Rebecca was also confused with this question but there doesn't seem to
a definitive answer (when she asked in Slack) to this question.

##Can you output all the txt files in this directory?##

yes, by entering **cat *.txt > directory** you can output all .txt files to the directory you choose.
