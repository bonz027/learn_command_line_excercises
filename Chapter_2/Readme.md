> What directory are you in?

I would run pwd and it would show me /Users/OC/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2015/homework/learn_command_line_excercises

> Are you in the class directory?

Yes! When I type pwd (print working directory) in iTerm, it shows the current directory. I know I am in the class
directory because when I type pwd it shows I am in the *davinci_coders_t2_2015 directory.*
 
> Are you in your home directory? 
 
I am in my home directory. This is easily visible when entering a terminal the beginning of the line states my home 
directory which is *Omars-MacBook*.

> What directory did you run that command in?

To find the directory, first I typed in *which ls* in the terminal which gives me the exact directory I am in. 
In doing so, I found out that I was in the */bin/ls* directory.

> Explain the process for finding the path with your graphical file browser.

First I open finder (located in my dock) then select my user name (OC) then click open workspace, then open the 
davinci coders folder, and I am there.
