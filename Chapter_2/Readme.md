I would run pwd and it would show me /Users/OC/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2015/homework/learn_command_line_excercises

> Are you in the class directory?

Yes! When I type pwd (print working directory) in iTerm, it shows the current directory. I know I am in the class
directory because when I type pwd it shows I am in the *davinci_coders_t2_2015 directory.*
