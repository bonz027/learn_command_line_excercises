##Can you touch blah.txt?##

yes, by cd into the new directory I created for this assignment, then I type **touch blah.txt** into the terminal. 

##Let's create foo.txt##

already in the same folder i created, i type **foo.txt**

##Explain what happens when if you touch an existing file. 

from the looks of it, It seems the command line recognizes that a similar file already exist and doesn't create it.
