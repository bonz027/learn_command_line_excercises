##Can you touch blah.txt?##

yes, by cd into the new directory I created for this assignment, then I type **touch blah.txt** into the terminal. 

##Let's create foo.txt##

already in the same folder i created, i type **touch foo.txt**

##Explain what happens when if you touch an existing file. 

from the looks of it, It seems the command line recognizes that a similar file already exist and doesn't create it. 
I entered **ls -l** into the command line and I see that a time stamp of 
**-rw-r--r--  1 OC  staff  0 May 31 17:58 iamcool.txt** comes back. I am guessing that the existing file is just 
overwritten by the new command??
