# Explain what the pushd and popd commands do.

*pushd* 

this command sets the directory as the directory to return to when executing the *pod* command.

*popd* 

this command returns to the path at the top of the directory. 

#Explain what directories you visited. 

I bounced through my *home* directory then back to my */Chapter_8* directory but then kind of got lost.
