# Explain what the pushd and popd commands do.

*pushd* 

this command (from what I understand) saves the current working directory in memory so it can be returned to at 
any time.

*popd* 

this command returns to the path at the top of the directory. 

#Explain what directories you visited. 

I bounced through my *home* directory then back to my */Chapter_8* directory but then kind of got lost.
