#What host are you on?

To find out what host I am on, open the iTerm and type in "hostname" which give me my current host name which is 
*Omars-Macbook.local*

#Are you on your local machine?

I know I am on my local machine because at the end of my opening line I can see the "$" which let's me know that i am
on my local machine.
