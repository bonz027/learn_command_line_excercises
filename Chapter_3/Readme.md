#What host are you on?

To find out what host I am on, open the iTerm and type in "hostname" which give me my current host name which is 
*Omars-Macbook.local*

#Are you on your local machine?

by running "hostname" i can see that it says **omars-macbook.local** which indicates i am on my local machine.
