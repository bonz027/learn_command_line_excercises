#Can you remove the tmp directory?
If you wanted to, but the files in this directory are only temporary stored and you can delete the files in the dr if 
needed. The command you would use to delete this is **rmdir tmp** 

#Let's remove the tmp directory.

I would type in *rmdir tmp* to delete the tmp directory. 
Because I have files currently being used in the tmp directory, it will not allow me to delete the directory.

#Made these 20 directories:
~/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2015/homework/learn_command_line_excercises/Chapter_7/tmp/sportsmoves/crossover/dribble3/
