##Can you rename foo.txt to blah.txt##

Already in the **Chapter_11/temp/** directory I would create bot txt files by entering
**touch blah.txt foo.txt** in the command line, then entering **mv foo.txt blah.txt**

##Can you move the production.log file in the log directory to slash temp?##

After creating the log directory (already in the temp directory i would enter mkdir log/, then cd log/) 
enter **mv production.log /tmp**

##Can you Zero out that file##

cp /dev/null production.log
